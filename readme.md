### Purpose of the project:

Increase customer interaction with the website by utilising UX research methodologies to create a design that suits the target audiences wants and needs.

The theoretical problem:

_Customer engagement with the existing Botanical Garden website is extremely low. Wellington City Council is wanting to develop a new dedicated homepage that is more engaging and inviting to increase visitor numbers to the garden._

### Summary of UX Research findings:

* The majority of our respondents use mobile devices over desktop devices. Respondents stated they disliked the sizing issues of informative sites on mobile.

* The main reason for respondents to not use the existing site was either that it was not advertised anywhere, they didn't know it existed or didn't feel a need to.

Most popular reasons for attending the gardens:

* 55%  Relax
* 38% Picnics
* 38% Multiple Gardens
* 28% Photography
* 28% Events
* 22% Cafe

Top feedback and suggestions for improvements to the site:

_I don't enjoy the way the "Our Gardens" section on the front page pops out and obscures other areas of the websites. I feel the website as a whole is a little old-fashioned_

_Website quite wordy, could be simplified and lacking in visual representation._

_Update the theme and transitions as they seem outdated...more photos of the gardens so we can see all of the garden's glory_

With these findings the site was designed to focus heavily on key attractions and areas of interest within the gardens by relying on image heavy design in a mobile friendly and responsive environment.

#### Bootstraps
[Get Bootstraps](https://getbootstrap.com/)

Both version 4 & 5 have been used for this project. The mobile nav relies on version 4 while the carousel relies on version 5.

Main bootstraps components include the mobile navigation and carousel.

###### Carousel Example:

```html
<div id="carouselExampleCaptions" class="carousel slide carousel-fade" data-bs-ride="carousel">
  <div class="carousel-indicators">
    <button type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExampleCaptions" data-bs-slide-to="0" class="active" aria-current="true" aria-label="Slide 1"></button>
```
